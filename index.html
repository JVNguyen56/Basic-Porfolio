      <p> My name is Jimmy Nguyen and I am currently employed by and auto insurance company, Infinity Insurance, where I handle special investigations to identify fraudulent claims. I came from a background of Finance and graduated from California State University of Northridge where I obtained a bachelors in Finance and a minor degree in Real Estate. Right out of school, I landed a job in the Mortgage field as a account executive for a wholesale lending company. I spent almost a decade working with this company and worked my way up to become the regional manager of sales. With the unstability of the mortgage market and changes in my personal life, I was forced to secure a more stable career field and that is what led me to the insurance industry. I have been in this field for over 10 years now and have been with 3 different companies and have help multiple positions within each company. This is where I am today. As new father to twins, I needed a better way to support my family. After some research and networking, I was able to locate the UCI Coding bootcamp where they offered a part-time program. This was a dream come true. I immediately enrolled and started with all of the pre-work assignments. Now we are at the start of our classes and am excited to see where this new venture leads me.
